[mod-setting-description]
mx-ede-max-level=Number of levels to generate. More levels will provide a more fine grained difficulty buildup. Level 1 always corresponds to evolution factor of 0, while max level always corresponds to evolution factor of 1.
mx-ede-max-level-hp-scale=The HP will be multiplied by an amount growing from 1x at level 1 to this value at max level. It's highly recommended to turn off vanilla evolution when using this option, as vanilla evolution applies a 10x HP scaling when fully evolved.
mx-ede-distance-to-max-level=Distance over which to grow the levels linearly. At this distance (plus distance scaling offset) and beyond, all enemy spawners will be max level.
mx-ede-distance-first-level-offset=Distance by which the scaling will be offset. Effectively grows the innermost circle with level 1 enemies by this amount.
